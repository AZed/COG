DESCRIPTION

Django application that provides a web interface to the ESMF Grid remapping utility, which allows to compute the transformation weights
from a source grid to a destination grid. These weights can then be used to transform a field of values defined on the source grid into
a fields of values defined on the destination grid.

The web application is exposed in two ways:

a) As a web form, that allows the user to select the source and destination grids. The web form URL is:
                            http://<hostname>:<port>/remap/
After submitting the web form, the server redirects the browser to the REST web service (see below).

b) As a REST web service, which can be invoked programmatically by a desktop client. The URL of the rest web service is:
                            http://<hostname>:<port>/remap/srcgrid=.../dstgrid=.../weights=.../
Upon successful completion, the REST web service returns the weights file (in NetCDF format) as an attachment to the HTTP response.
